              Hi there, I'm João, a 22-year-old living in Marco de Canaveses,
              Porto. <br />
              I'm deeply passionate about game design, sports, and programming.
              <br />
              I hold a Master's Degree in Informatics Engineering from FEUP.
              <br />
              If you share the same love for games as I do, why not have some
              fun playing Space Invaders on my arcade console? <br />
              Alternatively, you can explore some of the projects i did during
              my university time!
            </p>
            <p class="slide">
              I have a strong passion for psychology, which inspired my master's
              thesis project: a serious game called Emotion Odyssey. This game
              helps adolescents and their parents understand emotions and learn
              effective emotion regulation strategies. The project involved
              collaboration with adolescents, parents, and psychologists through
              interviews and questionnaires to ensure the game met their needs.
              Created in Unity2D, you can see a glimpse of it in the following
              slide, featuring a video trailer.
